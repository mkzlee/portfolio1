I like to read nonfiction books, often about health and medicine, but I've also a serious penchant for non-romance stories with romance and stories where the main character has moral dilemmas. My all-time favourites are the following (<b class="text-warning">SPOILERS?</b>):</p> 
                <br><dl class="row"><!--Bootstrap Description List Start--><!--to people who have actually read these books: sorry for the bad summaries. I do not claim to be a writer nor do I have any experience in judging inanimate objects. It would probably be better for the world if I didn't become a writer anyways, ahaha. also The Saga of the Seven Suns and the Shadow Games are slightly NSFW (like more than what's in most romance stories fifth graders read) which I didn't realize at all back when I read them 3-4 years ago, haha.-->
                  <dt class="col-sm-3 bg-info-subtle"><i>The Saga of the Seven Suns</i>, by Kevin J. Anderson</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9 bg-warning-subtle">A seven book series where humans blew up a planet and the aliens living there didn't like that. War ensues, involving several different species of aliens and dozens of points of view to see from. In my opinion, the story got less realistic (i.e. worse) as it went on and some of the characters whose POV I saw where not very interesting (*cough* Anton). Also loses points for length, but most of the characters were great! Older and wordier writing style which makes it kind of hard but interesting to read.</dd>
                
                  <dt class="col-sm-3 bg-warning-subtle"><i>Divergent</i>, by Veronica Roth</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9 bg-info-subtle">A trilogy about a rebellious girl who tries to <span>escape the boundaries of her dystopian world, which turns out to be the doings of an extremely intricate government experiment</span>. Loved the characters a lot! They were very funny at times, and at others very serious. If I recall correctly, I believe these had the thickest volumes out of the ones on this list-- but I still wish there were more.</dd>
                
                  <dt class="col-sm-3 bg-info-subtle"><i>The Mortality Doctrine</i>, by James Dashner</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9 bg-warning-subtle">A trilogy of fiction novels where there is a digital world that most teens spend the majority of their time in. The digital world, filled with games and rewards, is more dangerous than it seems. Protaganist is in a constant state of suffering. Appears similar to Ready Player 1 at first, but this series has higher stakes and a different kind of threat. Although in RP2, this comment doesn't hold up as they'll just kinda die if they fail.</dd>
                
                  <dt class="col-sm-3 bg-warning-subtle"><i>The Shadow Games</i>, by Amanda Foody</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9 bg-info-subtle">A trilogy of fictitious books where a well-mannered girl moves to a new city ruled by gangs in search of her missing mother. She and a gang leader she met are forced into a card game where you gamble lives instead of money. <span>When they win, they become wanted fugitives and are targeted by the entire city making for a very exciting sequel</span>. I liked the magic system, where each person has a stronger blood talent and a weaker split talent determined by parentage. It's important to the story, but talents aren't weaponized and are used in interesting ways. I also liked how the two protaganists are very similar, yet very different and their changes throughout the novel are extremely noticable. Currently being re-read so I can properly enjoy the new third novel, <i>Queen of Volts</i>.</dd>
                
                  <dt class="col-sm-3 bg-info-subtle"><i>The Inheritance Games</i>, by Jennifer Lynn Barnes</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9 bg-warning-subtle">This trilogy is about a normal teenager who is revealed to be the sole inheritor of a multi-billionaire. To obtain this money, she is required to live on the estate with the dead man's family for one year. The dead billionaire left puzzles and mysteries everywhere, so she and the billionaire's grandchildren scramble to solve them. I liked how the protaganist was always the least special out of the main cast, leading her to make... decisions with somewhat questionable logic to prove herself. By the end of the third book, she's dating the youngest grandson and has broken up with the middle.</dd>

                  <dt class="col-sm-3 bg-warning-subtle"><i>The Naturals</i>, by Jennifer Lynn Barnes</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9 bg-info-subtle">The Naturals is a story about a girl with a natural talent for reading others. She is recruited by the government into a group of people like her and works to solve unsolvable crimes. </dd>

                <p>All of these books are really special to me, but I read each several years ago so my memories are not very clear. In fact, I read them so long ago that <i>The Saga of the Seven Suns</i> got a whole three-book prequel while <i>The Shadow Games</i> and <i>The Inheritance Games</i> both got a third and final book in the form of <i>Queen of Volts</i> and <i>The Final Gambit</i>, respectively. Honorable mentions to <i>Death Match</i> by Logan Child. Naturally, this also goes to the <i>Harry Potter</i> and Percy Jackson series by J.K. Rowling and Rick Riordian, respectively.</p>
