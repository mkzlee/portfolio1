Imbalances in hormone levels results in diseases only curable by an endocrinologist. That's where I come in! I'll be able to diagnosis and prescribe medicine to treat the disease, which are impossible to cure without correcting the hormone imbalance. Some examples of these diseases are diabetes (insulin) and growth hormone deficiency.</p></div>

                <div class="col-9"><br><p>This is Kent State, one of the largest public universities in Ohio. My mom went here! It has a premed program and honors collage to appeal to those who are academically focused. It has a super high acceptance rate at 87%, and offers loads of merit scholarship to complement its relatively cheap tuition of 20k-ish/year. It has a beautiful campus, and resides in a politically tame pocket of Ohio. Being a public school, I have a shot at some of the sports as well. Unfortunately, it is located in a mostly rural state, so there isn't a whole lot to do there. Fortunately, I love going on walks through nothingness! <b class="text-primary">Click the image to see Kent's webpage for more information!</b></p></div>
                <div class="col-9"><br><br><p>This is Northeastern University, a prestigious school with many campuses throughout North America and the UK. It's a little harder to get into (18%--ish), but I bet I could do it! Its special internship programs would allow me to gain experience and build relationships with companies long before I've graduated, and I'm allowed to travel to its different locations and take classes there. This would be an excellent opportunity to learn more about the habits of the English and Canadian peoples. Its primary location is located in Boston, a beautiful city filled with shops and museums to learn more at. Even better, it's by the sea! This means good views, seafood and my favorite kind of weather. Like Kent, it has a premed program which would help set me up for my chosen profession. <b class="text-primary">Click the image to see Northeastern's webpage for more information!</b></p></div>
